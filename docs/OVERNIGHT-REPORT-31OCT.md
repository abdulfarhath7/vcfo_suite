# Overnight report, 31 Oct 2026

Built by the hub session with six parallel agents, on the owner's order ("Build everything… never require any approvals… built, committed, and pushed").
Branch `overnight/31oct`, merged into `main`. Every milestone has its own report in `docs/ui-port/fixes/overnight-*.md`.

## 1. Next actions (owner)

| # | Action | Why | Done |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Apply migrations **0031** (Board resolution NOC) and **0032** (task `sort_order`) on RDS **before** you deploy this code. Use the SSM tunnel through the NAT instance (`node scripts/db-env-prod.mjs`, see `docs/context/AWS-DEPLOY.md` §11). Take an RDS snapshot first. Never open RDS to the internet. | Without them, the board resolution pages and every task list fail. | ✗ |
| 2 | Commit your laptop-only SOC 2 infra files (`infra/private-db.tf` and the edited `infra/*.tf`) and merge them with `main`. Then run `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`. | `infra/network.tf` in git still shows the old public setup. M7 edited only the files that are in git. | ✗ |
| 3 | Create the `vcfo-suite/CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret, if your laptop files do not already create it. Then `terraform apply`. | M7 moves TOTP encryption to this key. | ✗ |
| 4 | Build and push the image of `main`, with a rollback tag of the live image (`0f34763`). | This session has no AWS access. | ✗ |
| 5 | Run `npm run totp:reencrypt -- --dry-run`, then `npm run totp:reencrypt`, through the tunnel. | It moves the TOTP secrets to the new key. | ✗ |
| 6 | Test the app. Send the bugs to the hub. | Owner's testing rule: no browser tests were run overnight. | ✗ |

## 4. Decisions made overnight (change any of them)

| # | Area | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hub | The builder on the laptop refused production actions without the owner's word in its own chat. The hub built everything itself with six parallel agents. |
| 2 | M1 | Light page background `#edf1f6`, one step darker than white cards. Dark mode already had the step. |
| 3 | M1 | Pages that draw their own 1.5 px card frame get 2 px from one rule at the end of `globals.css`; client-portal cards from a temporary `!important` rule in `23-portal.css`. |
| 4 | M1 | New `border-dash-fine` (3 px dash, 3 px gap) only for drop zones and empty states. Other dashed edges are now solid. |
| 5 | M1 | New shared `StepLink` draws each connector through the mark centres (11 places fixed). |
| 6 | M2 | "Steps done" counts SPICe+ steps. The Expected COI date moved into the note of that tile. |
| 7 | M2 | Trend lines are rebuilt from real records for the last days. A tile with no history shows a flat dashed line and "No history yet". |
| 8 | M3 | Three stat cards on top: Days to COI (Incorporated after the COI), SPICe+ steps, All steps. |
| 9 | M4 | A new optional `signed` flag on document rows marks signed files (no schema change). |
| 10 | M5 | Past chats on the full Ask page are kept in localStorage (40 per user). A server list is still a gap. |
| 11 | M6 | "A date agreed with the client" = the manager-set window on a step; a lead's drag opens the date-change request. Compliance tasks the client sees move freely for managers. |
| 12 | M6 | Staff compliance calendar tab "Month" is renamed "Calendar". Clients keep the old month grid. |
| 13 | M7 | The Auth.js config is built per request, so the Entra secret can rotate without a redeploy. |
| 14 | M7 | `ignore_changes` on the AUTH_SECRET and Azure secret versions, so `terraform apply` does not undo a hand rotation. |
| 15 | M7 | `apprunner:DescribeService` added (read-only) for the Network card. |
| 16 | M8 | The demo seed also uploads placeholders for demo request files. |

## 5. Known gaps

| # | Gap |
|---|---|
| 1 | X-20 holidays, X-22 retention, X-24 Meta template: they wait for the owner. |
| 2 | P-304, P-305, P-312 developer console rows: not built. |
| 3 | Ask full page: no server list of past chats; suggested-question answers of the client pop-up do not show on the full page. |
| 4 | The WhatsApp verify-code hash still uses AUTH_SECRET. A code sent just before a rotation fails once. |
| 5 | Landing check T6 (Lighthouse) was never run. |

## 6. Deploy, 31 Oct 2026 10:32 IST

| Step | Done | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Laptop SOC 2 infra files in git | ✓ | Branch `infra/soc2-laptop`, merged with main. `terraform validate` passes. |
| `main` | ✓ | Fast-forwarded to `0f746dfc`. |
| RDS snapshot | ✓ | `vcfo-suite-db-pre-0031-20261031-1021`. |
| Migrations 0031 and 0032 on RDS | ✓ | Applied through the SSM tunnel on the NAT instance. RDS stayed private. The tunnel is closed. |
| Rollback image | ✓ | `vcfo-suite:rollback-0f34763` (the image that was live before). |
| Image | ✓ | `vcfo-suite:0f746dfc` and `:latest`. App Runner START_DEPLOYMENT succeeded at 10:32 IST. |
| Live check | ✓ | `/` and `/login` answer 200. No errors in the application log after the deploy. Not checked signed in. |
| `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` secret | ✗ | Not created. The tool that runs commands blocked writes to Secrets Manager. Two-step codes keep working with the old `t1` format. |
| `terraform apply` | ✗ | Not run. The plan is 3 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy: the key secret and its policy, the M7 read-only console grant, and the App Runner env and secret list. |
| `totp:reencrypt` | ✗ | Waits for the key secret. |

To finish, the owner runs these from `infra/` (the plan above, nothing else):

```bash
terraform apply -var credentials_key_enabled=true -target='aws_secretsmanager_secret.credentials_encryption_key[0]' -target='aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy.credentials_encryption_key[0]'
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --profile vcfo --region ap-south-1 --secret-id vcfo-suite/CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY --secret-string "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
terraform apply -var credentials_key_enabled=true   # then set it to true in terraform.tfvars
```

Then run `npm run totp:reencrypt` through the tunnel (docs/context/AWS-DEPLOY.md §11.3).
