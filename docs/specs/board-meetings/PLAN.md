# Board meetings — plan and owner decisions

Owner: SBC. Decided in the 2 Nov 2026 session; designs on the "Create Board Meeting Notice"
canvas (claude.ai artifact FZAzHTLVDseikA8QWqHm1X) and the plan PDF ("Board Meeting Workflow
Plan", draft 6). This file is the spec the code follows.

Status 2026-11-02: built end to end on `claude/determined-planck-9hnlhx` (see `docs/context/STATE.md`).
Not built yet: e-signature (signers still sign on paper and the lead uploads the signed copy),
and marking the post-1 checklist step done automatically when the first meeting's MoM locks.

## Workflow

| Day | Step | Who |
|---|---|---|
| T-10 | VCFO tells the lead to prepare the notice (task + bell + email) | System |
| T-10 to T-8 | Lead drafts the notice and agenda: director picker, agenda picker, copy from last meeting | Lead |
| T-8 to T-7 | Lead sends it for approval. The manager may edit the text, recipients, date, time and agenda, then approves or sends back | Manager |
| T-7 | On approval VCFO emails the notice: To the ticked directors and the CS, CC admin, manager, lead and others. Word file and `.ics` attached, Google and Outlook links, Teams link when the lead's Outlook allows it | System |
| T-7 to T-0 | Directors reply "I will attend / I can't attend" from the email (no sign-in). Quorum forecast (Sec 174). Reschedule and cancel send an update with the same calendar UID | Directors, lead |
| ≤ T+30 | Lead uploads the MoM received outside VCFO. VCFO emails it to the directors present for signature. The lead uploads the signed copy: locked. Final copy emailed to all directors, admin and lead | Lead, directors |
| After | Lead adds resolutions passed after the meeting, on the letterhead layout of a resolution by circulation. The selected directors sign (no manager step). Signed copy uploaded: locked. Final copy emailed to all | Lead, directors |
| Next notice | Locked resolutions become sub-points of "resolutions passed since the previous Board Meeting" (BM-007). After the next notice is sent, new resolutions go to the next meeting | System |

## Decisions

- One notice signature line (typed signatory name and DIN); no director signature before sending.
- Only the manager approves the notice; the admin is in CC.
- VCFO does not write minutes. There is one "Upload MoM" button; there is no "Request MoM".
- The resolutions list holds only resolutions added after the meeting; the MoM PDF holds the rest.
- Signed documents are locked: no edit, no replace.
- Phase 1 signing is "signed copy uploaded by the lead"; e-sign inside VCFO is a later phase.
- No new sidebar item. Placement: Incorporation › post-1 (first meeting), Compliances › Obligations
  › Non-statutory › New task › Type: Meeting (next meetings), Approvals (manager), Home card and
  the Obligations "Meetings" filter (admin), Firm settings › Agenda library, the client's
  Directors section, Compliances › Calendar, and the client portal Home, Obligations and Documents.
- The agenda library is the SBC master sheet (224 items, 16 topics) in
  `src/data/board-agenda-library.ts`, editable in Firm settings.
