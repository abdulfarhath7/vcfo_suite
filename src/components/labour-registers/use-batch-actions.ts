/**
 * Closing a period, reopening it, and building its registers.
 *
 * Three calls, deliberately not two. `markReady` refuses a second call, but generation has to
 * stay retryable: a failure halfway through twenty-nine registers must be recoverable by
 * pressing the button again, and every form that already succeeded will then be a cache hit.
 * So the close posts, and then generation posts, and a failure of the second does not undo the
 * first.
 *
 * What comes back from generation is worth showing rather than swallowing. "Twenty of twenty
 * served from storage" is the whole argument for the caching design, and a blocked form naming
 * what it was short of is more use than a count of successes.
