/**
 * THE COMPLIANCE ACTIVITY MASTER (Developer requirement 01) — real data, not sample data.
 *
 * Sources, supplied by the owner on 29 Oct 2026 and carried over from the prototype's
 * `src/data/activity-master.ts` (main e86ce88):
 *   - SBC_TRACK_Consolidated_Compliance_Activity_Master.xlsx, sheet 'Consolidated Activity Master'
 *     (31 rows, ACT-001 to ACT-031), with the 'Deduplication Mapping' applied.
 *   - SBC_Registration_Compliance_Manual_4.docx, the due-date tables with the penalty for each.
 * Rows with `from: 'manual'` are statutory due dates the manual lists but the master does not.
 * `confirm` holds a point the owner must confirm before production reminders go live (DR-19, DR-22).
 *
 * This file seeds the `compliance_activities` table (`src/db/repositories/compliance-activities.ts`
 * `systemEnsureActivitiesSeeded`, and `scripts/seed-compliance-activities.ts`). The table is the
 * source the app reads; this file only fills it once, so an admin's later edits are kept.
 * Docs: docs/ui-port/COMPLIANCE-API.md, the prototype's docs/COMPLIANCE-MODEL.md section 3.1.
