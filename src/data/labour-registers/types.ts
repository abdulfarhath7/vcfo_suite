/**
 * LABOUR REGISTERS — the shapes the catalogue is written in.
 *
 * A register is a dated rendering of one canonical dataset, never a bespoke document. The
 * catalogue therefore describes forms, and the generator projects the dataset through them.
 *
 * Two findings from the November 2026 research shape these types, and both are recorded in
 * `docs/context/notes/labour-registers.md`:
 *
 *  1. A form number is not an identity. Form XXII is the Register of Employment in Telangana,
 *     the Register of Advances under the central Contract Labour rules, and the register of
 *     hours of work in Goa. Every form is therefore keyed on jurisdiction, act, rule, number
 *     and title together, and `FormSpec.id` is the only safe handle.
 *  2. The four labour codes commenced on 21 November 2025 and the central rules under all four
 *     were notified on 8 May 2026, while Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Haryana have not
 *     notified final state rules. A client in those states is on a hybrid regime, so a form
 *     carries the window in which it applies and the catalogue is always read for a date.
 *
 * Nothing here was verified against the gazette: the research ran without access to
 * indiacode.nic.in or labour.gov.in. `FormSpec.verification` records that honestly, and the
 * generator prints it on the document rather than implying an authority we have not checked.

/**
 * A state or union territory, by its ISO 3166-2:IN subdivision code without the `IN-` prefix.
 *
 * Every subdivision the map draws is here, whether or not its forms are configured. They used
 * to be eleven, which made the picker say "7 other states and union territories" when the map
 * beside it drew thirty-five — an undercount of twenty-four, and in the data rather than the
 * copy. `JK` covers Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh together, because the 2019 division is not in
 * the licensed geometry and inventing that boundary is the thing not to do.

 * telecommunications, civil aviation and central public sector undertakings — and the State
 * for everything else, which is nearly every ordinary commercial establishment.
 *
 * The Central Rules bind only the first group. Producing a central-code register for a shop in
 * Hyderabad is not a harmless extra: it is a sheet nobody asked for, with an authority line
 * citing rules that do not govern the client, handed to an inspector who will ask why.
