# src/lib

Domain logic and helpers. Nothing here imports `db`; data access goes through
`src/db/repositories/*`. Tests sit next to the code as `*.test.ts`. React hooks live in
`src/hooks/`, not here.

## Folders

- `api/` — helpers shared by `app/api/**` route handlers (body parsing, schemas, generate and access checks).
- `ask/` — Ask VCFO: retrieval, prompts, guards, PDF briefs and the tool calls it can make.
- `assist-profile/` — builds the company profile that the vcfo_assist browser extension fills into MCA portals.
- `audit/` — audit-log display formatting and the role rules for who sees which audit events.
- `board-resolution/` — board resolution data model, docx generation, preview and storage keys.
- `checklist/` — the 34-step SPICe+ checklist: per-step validation, gating, review, locks, responses and Part A sections.
- `client/` — client overview, home (`/api/client/home`) and progress-board shapes, shared by the portal and the legacy client views.
- `client-portal/` — the v7 client portal's pure models (answers, compliances, credentials, documents, steps).
- `compliance/` — the recurring compliance calendar: FY periods, obligation instances and the filings register.
- `doc-pack/` — the incorporation document pack registry, inputs and what blocks each document.
- `documents/` — vault and milestone document visibility rules and storage keys.
- `email/` — outbound email (`send-email.ts`, the system of record), layout and engagement event mail.

- `incorporation-docs/` — generators for the MCA incorporation documents (MOA, AOA, INC-9, DIR-2, DIR-8 and letters).
- `intern/` — the project lead's (intern role) dashboard, work queue, managers and personal todos.
- `knowledge-bank/` — knowledge bank folders, search and storage keys.
- `noc/` — the parent company NOC (Pre-2 board resolution) templates and variants.
- `notifications/` — in-app bell, announcements, popup cadence and the dock animation.
- `notify/` — WhatsApp nudges (outbound only; never blocks email).
- `outlook/` — Microsoft Outlook OAuth and token encryption for sending mail as a user.
- `projects/` — engagements (projects): create scope, DB helpers, change requests, step paths, stuck rules, schedule windows, deadlines and pending approvals.
- `shell/` — app chrome: shell appearance, brand name, motion presets, phase colours and page metadata.
- `super/` — the super admin overview shape builder.
