/**
 * The route one chat message took, cheapest first. It is stored on `ask_messages.path` and on
 * `ask_usage_daily.path`; the token report groups by it and `ASK_KILL_PATHS` switches one off.
 *
 * suggestion, context, metric_local, topic_local, greeting_local and saved_answer call no model.
 * greeting_local also carries a typed "what can you do?", which code answers from the action registry.
 * router_* answers spent only the router call. document_answer and tool_answer spent the router
 * and one answer call. fixed_workflow and agent_run belong to the Do engine, watch to Watch.
 * ingest is no chat message: it is what indexing a source spends, reported beside the rest.
 * assist_resolve is no chat message either: the VCFO Assist T3 field resolver (`src/lib/assist-agents/resolve.ts`).
