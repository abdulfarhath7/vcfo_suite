/**
 * LABOUR REGISTERS — which forms apply, and what they need.
 *
 * The catalogue in `src/data/labour-registers/` is a list of every form we know. This file
 * turns it into an answer to the only question a preparer asks: for this client, in this
 * state, for this month, what has to be produced?
 *
 * The answer is a hybrid, and that is the point. The four labour codes commenced on 21
 * November 2025 and the central rules were notified on 8 May 2026, but none of Telangana,
 * Karnataka, Kerala or Haryana has notified final state rules. A client in those states
 * therefore owes the central code registers AND its state's existing registers for the same
 * month. A generator that picked one stack would under-file.
