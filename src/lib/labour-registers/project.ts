/**
 * LABOUR REGISTERS — one roll, one form, one printable table.
 *
 * A register is a dated rendering of the canonical dataset, never a bespoke document. This is
 * the rendering step: it takes the roll `dataset.ts` assembled and projects it through one
 * form's prescribed columns, in the order the prescribed sheet prints them.
 *
 * It is pure. Given the same roll and the same form it produces the same table, which is what
 * lets a document be content-addressed: the same inputs give the same bytes, so a stored file
 * can answer instead of a rebuild.
 *
 * **A prescribed column is never removed.** That is the rule the whole module is arranged
 * around. A form carries its columns whatever the client pays, and the research behind this
 * catalogue found that an electronic register may change its layout but not its "integrity,
 * serial number and column contents". So an optional column nobody mapped prints its heading
 * with nothing under it, and the fact is reported three ways — on the column, in a footnote,
 * and in the evidence manifest — rather than being quietly dropped.
