/**
 * CLIENT HOME "WAITING ON" AND "WITH SBC" TRENDS (R-18, C-023) — the pure part.
 *
 * Both tiles count the steps of the incorporation model by who holds them
 * (`engagement_step_events.holder`, migration 0028, words from `step-holder.ts`):
 *   Waiting on <company>  open document requests + steps held by `client`
 *   With SBC              steps held by `lead` or `manager` (the model's kind `with`). `sbc`
 *                         means the step is not open yet (kind `up`), which the tile does not
 *                         count, so it is left out here too.
 *
 * WRITE SIDE. A step's holder can change without a status or review change of its own: when
 * the step before it finishes, a gated step opens. `holderChanges` therefore compares the
 * holders of every model step before and after a save and adds a holder-only row (from and to
 * status equal, so step timing skips it; the review state only when it is "reviewing") for
 * each step whose holder moved. The first save of an
 * engagement after this rule shipped writes a baseline row for every model step, so the
 * history has a known starting point (`since`).
 *
 * READ SIDE. The holder of a step at a day end is the holder of its last row before then, on or
 * after `since`. A day that ends before `since`, or a step with no row in that window, makes
 * the day unknown, and `trailingKnown` drops it and every earlier day. Nothing is estimated.
