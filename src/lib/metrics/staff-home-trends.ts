/**
 * STAFF HOME TREND LINES — the pure part for the lead, manager and admin homes (R-18).
 *
 * The rules of `home-trends.ts` hold here too: a past value is drawn only when the stored rows
 * say what the tile showed at the end of that day, and a day whose value cannot be known ends
 * the series (`trailingKnown`). Two series can be rebuilt:
 *
 *   Awaiting approval (manager "Needs your approval", admin "Awaiting approval")
 *     Steps whose review state was "reviewing" at the end of the day. The review state of a
 *     step at a past moment is the `review_status` of its last recorded event before then, or
 *     its current state when nothing was recorded since. Review history starts with the first
 *     event that carries a review state (`reviewSince`); before that day nothing is known.
 *
 *   Done today (lead)
 *     Steps that moved to completed during the day and were still completed at its end, from
 *     the status events; tasks whose `completed_at` falls in the day; and filings due that day
 *     that were filed by its end (the live tile counts filed filings by their due day). Status
 *     history starts with the first recorded step event (`statusSince`).
 *
 * Scope is the caller's engagements today: who led or managed a client on a past day is not
 * stored, so a client that changed hands is counted under its current team.
