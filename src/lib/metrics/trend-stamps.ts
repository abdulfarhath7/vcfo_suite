/**
 * TREND STAMPS — the "when did it close" columns behind the staff home trend lines (R-18).
 *
 * Migration 0027 added three history columns. The repositories write them through these pure
 * helpers, so every write path stamps them the same way:
 *
 *   tasks.completed_at              set when a task moves to done, cleared when it reopens
 *   document_requests.closed_at     set when a request is fulfilled or cancelled, cleared
 *                                   when it opens again
 *   engagement_step_events.review_status
 *                                   the step's review state after each recorded change
 *
 * A patch is returned only when the state crosses the open/closed line, so a second "done"
 * on a task that is already done keeps the first completion time.
